## Project Description

Welcome to the adrenaline-pumping world of Street Fighter! This project is all about bringing the classic 2D fighting game experience to life. Here's a comprehensive overview of what we aim to accomplish:

- **Setting up the GUI:** We'll begin by creating the main game window using the powerful JFrame class from Swing. Customize the window's properties, size, and layout to provide the best gaming experience. A dedicated JPanel will serve as the canvas where all the action happens.

- **Designing the Splash Screen:** A visually stunning splash screen is essential to draw players into the game's universe. We'll create an eye-catching image or animation that perfectly captures the essence of Street Fighter, complete with the game's logo, iconic characters, and thematic elements.

- **Implementing the Splash Screen:** Building on our splash screen design, we'll create a separate class dedicated to managing the splash screen. This class extends JFrame and takes care of configuring the window's size, position, and visual content. We'll also add our meticulously designed splash screen and set a specific display duration before transitioning to the main game window.

- **Character and Background Design:** The heart of any fighting game lies in its characters and arenas. We'll either design or source sprite sheets for our characters, featuring a wide range of movements, from walking and jumping to powerful attacks. Additionally, we'll obtain or create stunning background images that showcase different fighting arenas. To keep things organized, we'll split our sprite sheets into individual image files for later animation.

- **Player Input:** To make our game responsive and dynamic, we'll implement keyboard input listeners. This will enable us to capture player actions and map specific keys to character movements (e.g., arrow keys for walking and jumping) and attacks (e.g., punch, kick). As players unleash their moves, our game will respond in real-time, providing an immersive gaming experience.

- **Game Logic:** Underneath the hood, we'll build the core game logic. This includes robust collision detection to determine when characters land successful attacks or collide with objects, such as the screen boundaries. We'll also manage character health, reducing it as attacks connect. A scoring system will keep track of each player's performance, leading to nail-biting matches.

- **Animation:** To breathe life into our characters, we'll create animation cycles using our sprite sheets. Defining sequences of sprite images will enable us to display various character movements and attacks. Using timers or animation loops, we'll smoothly transition between frames, creating the illusion of fluid motion and dynamic action.

- **Sound Effects and Music:** No fighting game is complete without the sounds of combat! We'll add impactful sound effects for character grunts, punches, kicks, and other actions. In addition, we'll incorporate background music that sets the mood for the game. The javax.sound.sampled package will be our ally in playing audio files at just the right moments.

- **Game Modes:** To provide variety and replay value, we'll implement different game modes. One of the highlights will be the two-player mode for local multiplayer, allowing two human players to go head-to-head in intense battles. Whether it's solo play or challenging a friend, our game will offer diverse experiences.

- **Testing and Refining:** A robust testing phase is crucial to identify and fix bugs or glitches. We'll put our game through rigorous testing, seeking feedback from players to understand areas for improvement. Our goal is to deliver a polished gaming experience with smooth animation and responsive controls.

- **Game Over and Victory Conditions:** When a character's health bar reaches zero, the opponent emerges victorious in the round. The player who achieves the required number of round wins first is declared the match winner. Excitingly, we'll create a victory screen that displays the winner's name and game statistics at the end of each match.

- **Deployment:** To share our creation with the world, we'll package the game as a standalone executable or a runnable JAR file. This will make it easy for players to enjoy the game on their own systems. We'll also explore various distribution channels, from hosting the game on a website to offering it as a download or even submitting it to gaming platforms.

Thank you for joining us on this thrilling adventure as we build a 2D Street Fighter game using Java and Swing. Feel free to explore the individual sections of this README for detailed guidance on each aspect of the project. Get ready to fight your way to victory and bring the excitement of Street Fighter to players worldwide!
